      This was my first game developed using unity and the main concept was to create a pong like game. 
The main struggle was thinking for the first time of a sort of structure to make make programming this game easily. 
I see every feature of this game and it wasnt too complex. 

<View className="flex-1">
      <ImageScroll key={"Bounce"} Title={"Bounce" } FeatureImages={BounceImages}></ImageScroll>
</View>

Every bounce increase the ball speed until a certain cap 

<View className="flex-1">
      <ImageScroll key={"RandomMap"} Title={"Random map" } FeatureImages={RandomMapImages}></ImageScroll>
</View>
Random map
At the begining of a round a random map will ne chosen and the game starts with that

<View className="flex-1">
      <ImageScroll key={"PopulationCount"} Title={"Population count" } FeatureImages={PopulationCountImages}></ImageScroll>
</View>
Population count 
The ball when goes into the goal area deals damage to the player of that area.
Greater is the speed greater is the damege

I think that this game needs a total refactor for gameplay mad refactor.
Gameplay: less use of singleton pattern that makes easier to access something from every part of the game but (ne risente la struttura del progetto). 
Ui: we had a lot of problem disabling all the widget and what is needed is to makes a better panel strutture to enable just the active panel. 

This game has one bug that we cannot resolve . In some cases the ball was too fast and goes outisde the walls. 
Now i think that i can fix this in this wayâ€¦ TODO

}
